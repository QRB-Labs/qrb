---

QRB Labs ICT Solutions PLC, a company established in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, was founded by entrepreneurs of Ethiopian origin. We offer data center services to international clients, focusing on location-agnostic high-energy computations such as Bitcoin mining, and AI model training. QRB is a customer of Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and procures surplus hydroelectric power, commonly referred to as "stranded" energy,  to operate scalable modular data centers. These data centers are strategically located within EEP substations across Ethiopia. The company plans to expand to two other African countries.
