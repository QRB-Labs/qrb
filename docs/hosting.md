### Services

Colocation service consists of data center space, internet
connectivity, power and all necessary infrastructure in secure
facilities. Customers have remote access to their servers via VPN, as well as physical site access for installation and maintenance of their servers, at no extra cost. We also provide optional "hands & eyes" services on demand, whereby our technicians will do on-site repairs, upgrades, handling etc. for the customer, at **$30/hour**.
